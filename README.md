## soful

Given the theme of social change and the topic of how we can utilize technology to bridge and reduce gaps of inequality within and between countries, we’ve decided to approach it through web based means. INTRODUCING SOFUL. SOFUL stands for source organization for unique learning. Soful is a navigational tool in which the user will input their learning style of choice and soful will organize results from the web pertaining to that specific type of learning. 

Ways Soful could be expanded upon would be to give the user a more extensive resource library to better meet their needs, and a more specific list of learning styles. An idea we had was to develop an artificial intelligence to analyze web sources under the criteria of the user’s learning style and then automatically form a composed list of resources that suit them. We believe this approach to this topic would be a great factor in the encouragement of social progress as inequality such as economic gaps and education gaps would be reduced substantially if people were to engage in learning in their own unique ways of intaking and applying information. This issue of learning generalization was the inspiration for the development of soful.
